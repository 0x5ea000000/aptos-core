# Introduction

**NOTE:** The Aptos Wallet ("Wallet") is in very early development. It is not production-ready and is not secure.

Wallet is an interface to the [Aptos blockchain](https://aptos.dev). Wallet is a free web application. Using Wallet, a user can store and transfer assets, create and view NFTs, and interact with the decentralized applications (dApps), all on the Aptos blockchain.

This developer documentation describes how to integrate Wallet into your dApp and enable your user to connect their Wallet to the Aptos blockchain. 

**NOTE:**: Wallet is currently available as a browser extension on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html).

The rest of the documentation describes in detail the following steps for your dApp integration:

- Checking for Wallet browser extension.
- Connecting to Wallet.
- Getting a user to sign, and optionally, send, a transaction to the Aptos blockchain.
- Getting a user to sign a message.
- Error messages.
