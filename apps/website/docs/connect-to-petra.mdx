# Connecting to Wallet

To use Wallet with your dApp, your user must first install Wallet on their Chrome browser. Wallet injects an `aptos` object into the [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) of any web app the user visits. 

To check if the user has installed Wallet, perform the below check:

```typescript
const isAptosInstalled = window.aptos
```

<br />
If Wallet is not installed, you can prompt the user to first install the Wallet extension and provide the below installation instructions. For example, see below:

```typescript
const getAptosWallet = () => {
    if ('aptos' in window) {
        return window.aptos;
    } else {
        window.open('https://petra.app/', `_blank`);
    }
}
```

## Installing the Wallet extension 

To install the Wallet extension on your Chrome browser, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest [Petra Wallet release](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases?q=wallet&expanded=true) and unzip.
2. Open a Chrome window and navigate to the Extensions using any of the below methods:
    - At the top right corner of the browser window, click the three vertical dots and then More tools and then Extensions, or
    - On a new tab or a window type `chrome://extensions` in the URL field and press return.
3. Enable **Developer mode** at the top right of the Extensions page.
4. Click on **Load unpacked** at the top left, and point it to the folder where you just unzipped the downloaded Wallet release.

Now you will see Wallet in your Chrome extensions.

## Connecting to Wallet

After confirming that the web app has the `aptos` object, we can connect to Wallet by calling `wallet.connect()`. 

When you call `wallet.connect()`, it prompts the user to allow your web app to make additional calls to Wallet, and obtains from the user basic information like the `address` and `public key`. 

See the example code below:

```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet();
try {
    const response = await wallet.connect();
    console.log(response); // { address: string, address: string }

    const account = await wallet.account();
    console.log(account); // { address: string, address: string }
} catch (error) {
    // { code: 4001, message: "User rejected the request."}
}
```

**NOTE**: After the user has approved the connnection for the first time, the web app's domain will be remembered for the future sessions. 

## Disconnecting Wallet

When you want the web app to forget about the connection status with Wallet, you can do this by calling `wallet.disconnect()` in your web app. See below:

```typescript
await wallet.disconnect();
```

**NOTE**: After disconnecting, the web app must reconnect to Wallet to make requests.
