# Sending a Transaction

After the web app is connected to Wallet, the web app can prompt the user to sign and send transactions to the Aptos blockchain.

Wallet API handles the transactions in the following two ways: 

1. Sign a transaction and submit it to the Aptos blockchain. Return a pending transaction to the web app. 
2. Sign a transaction but do not submit the transaction to the Aptos blockchain. Return the signed transaction to the web app, for the web app to submit the transaction. 

See the below examples for both the options. 

<Info>For more on Aptos transactions, see the&nbsp;[Aptos Typescript SDK](https://aptos-labs.github.io/ts-sdk-doc/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Transactions with Typescript SDK](https://aptos.dev/sdks/transactions-with-ts-sdk). </Info>


## Sign and submit

The below code example shows how to use the `signAndSubmitTransaction()` API to sign the transaction and send it to the Aptos blockchain.

```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"

// Example transaction
const transaction = {
    type: 'script_function_payload',
    function: '0x1::coin::transfer',
    type_arguments: ['0x1::test_coin::TestCoin'],
    arguments: ['<receiverAddress>', amount]
}

try {
    const pendingTransaction = await (window as any).aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction(transaction)
} catch (error)
    // see "Errors"
```


## Sign only

The below code example shows how to use the `signTransaction()` API to only sign the transaction, without submitting it to the Aptos blockchain.


```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"

// Example transaction
const transaction = {
    type: 'script_function_payload',
    function: '0x1::coin::transfer',
    type_arguments: ['0x1::test_coin::TestCoin'],
    arguments: ['<receiverAddress>', amount]
}

try {
    const signTransaction = await (window as any).aptos.signTransaction(transaction)
} catch (error)
    // see "Errors"
```
