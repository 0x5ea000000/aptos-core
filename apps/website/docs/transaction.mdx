# Sending a Transaction

Once a web app is connected to <CompanyName />, it can prompt the user to sign and send transactions.

There a couple different ways the wallet api handles transactions:
1. Sign a transaction, and then submit it to chain. Returing a pending transaction.
2. Sign a transaction. Returning the signed transaction to be submitted by the web app.

<Info>For more information about Aptos' transactions, please review the [sdk](https://aptos-labs.github.io/ts-sdk-doc/).</Info>


## Sign and Submit

```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"

// Example transaction
const transaction = {
    type: 'script_function_payload',
    function: '0x1::coin::transfer',
    type_arguments: ['0x1::test_coin::TestCoin'],
    arguments: ['<receiverAddress>', amount]
}

try {
    const pendingTransaction = await (window as any).aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction(transaction)
} catch (error)
    // see "Errors"
}
```


## Sign Transaction

```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"

// Example transaction
const transaction = {
    type: 'script_function_payload',
    function: '0x1::coin::transfer',
    type_arguments: ['0x1::test_coin::TestCoin'],
    arguments: ['<receiverAddress>', amount]
}

try {
    const signTransaction = await (window as any).aptos.signTransaction(transaction)
} catch (error)
    // see "Errors"
}
```
