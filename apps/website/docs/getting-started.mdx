# Getting started

*Note: <CompanyName /> is very early in development and not secure or production ready*

The *<CompanyName />* is a free application that is your interface to the Aptos blockchain. 
People can use the wallet to store and transfer assets, create and view NFTs, interact with 
decentralized applications (dApps), and engage with the Aptos ecosystem.

It is currently available as a browser extension on chrome.

To install the extension, follow these steps:
1. Download the latest [wallet release](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases/) and unzip
2. Open a Chrome window and navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right of the extension page
4. Hit **Load unpacked** and point it to the folder you just unzipped

Now you should see the <CompanyName /> in your chrome extensions!

*Hint: Open your downloaded extensions by clicking the puzzle piece icon in your Chrome toolbar*
