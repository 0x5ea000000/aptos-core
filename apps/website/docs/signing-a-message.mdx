# Signing Messages

A web app can also request the user to sign a message, by using <CompanyName /> API `wallet.signMessage(payload: SignMessagePayload)`. 

Web apps can write their own message, then send it to <CompanyName />. The user will be prompted to sign that message, and then the signed message will be returned to the web app.

The most common usecase for this function is to verify identity, but there are a few other possible use cases. You may notice some wallets from other chains just provide an interface to sign arbitrary strings. This is dangerous for various reasons and we want to provide a little more security here (with some extra optional security).

- `signMessage(payload: SignMessagePayload)` prompts the user with the `payload.message` to be signed
    - returns `Promise<SignMessageResponse>`

Types:
```typescript
export interface SignMessagePayload {
  address?: boolean; // Should we include the address of the account in the message
  application?: boolean; // Should we include the domain of the dapp
  chainId?: boolean; // Should we include the current chain id the wallet is connected to
  message: string; // The message to be signed and displayed to the user
  nonce: string; // A nonce the dapp should generate
}

export interface SignMessageResponse {
  address: string;
  application: string;
  chainId: number;
  fullMessage: string; // The message that was generated to sign
  message: string; // The message passed in by the user
  nonce: string,
  prefix: string, // Should always be APTOS
  signature: string; // The signed full message
}
```

### Example message and response
`signMessage({nonce: 1234034, message: "Welcome to dapp!" })`

This would generate the `fullMessage` to be signed and returned as the `signature`:
``` typescript
APTOS
nonce: 1234034
message: Welcome to dapp!
```

### Example usage:

```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"
const message = "hello";
const nonce = "random_string"

try {
    const signedMessage = await wallet.signMessage({ message: message, nonce: nonce }});
    // verify message
} catch (error) {
    // see "Errors"
}
```
