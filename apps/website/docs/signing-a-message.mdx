# Signing Messages

A web app can also request the user to sign a message, by using Wallet API `wallet.signMessage()`. 

Web apps can write their own message, then send it to Wallet. The user will be prompted to sign that message, and then the signed message will be returned to the web app. The most common usecase for this is verifying with the user the ownership of an address or public key.

See the example code below:

```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"

const message = "hello";

try {
    const signedMessage = await wallet.signMessage(message);
    // verify message
} catch (error) {
    // see "Errors"
}
```
